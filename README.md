Of course. Here is a detailed breakdown of the document types and the specific actions a player would perform on them. This structured list is designed to be easily interpreted for game development.

### List 1: Types of Pages/Documents

These are the various "nouns" of the game—the paper and information the player will interact with on their desk.

#### A. Primary Forms (Project-Driving Documents)
These are forms that must be processed to advance the core "Bench Project."

*   **F-37: Project Proposal Form:** The genesis of the entire quest. Contains the initial request, project name, location, and requesting party's signature.
*   **C-11: Budgetary Request Form:** Sent to the Finance department. Must detail every cost item (materials, labor) and match the total budget requested.
*   **M-03: Material Specification Sheet:** Details the physical properties of the bench (e.g., wood type, metal gauge, number of bolts). Must comply with Safety and Aesthetic rules.
*   **W-08: Work Order Request:** A form for the Municipal Workers Union. Specifies the type of labor required (e.g., Grade 2 Technician), estimated hours, and required tools.
*   **S-19: Safety Compliance Checklist:** A checklist from the Public Safety department. Must be filled out to confirm the bench meets all safety regulations (e.g., "no sharp edges," "splinter-free wood").
*   **AC-01: Aesthetic Harmony Submission:** A form for the Color Committee, requiring a color swatch to be attached and justified.
*   **F-99: Final Approval Certificate:** The "final boss" of the forms. It requires the signature/stamp from every other relevant department on a single page.

#### B. Ancillary & Response Forms (Loop-Generating Documents)
These forms are generated *in response* to the player's actions, often creating the bureaucratic loops.

*   **RFC-01: Request for Clarification:** Sent back from a department when information is vague or missing. Requires the player to find the info and resubmit.
*   **NOR-04: Notice of Rejection:** A formal denial from a department. Crucially, it has a section detailing the *reason* for rejection, which the player must use to correct the primary forms.
*   **RFA-12: Request for Additional Information:** A form asking for something not included on the original form (e.g., "Please attach an environmental impact report").
*   **PCI-07: Public Comment Intake Form:** A document where feedback from the public is recorded. May introduce absurd new requirements (e.g., "The bench must face east for spiritual reasons").

#### C. Reference Documents (Tools for Verification)
These are non-interactive in that they aren't stamped or forwarded, but are critical for checking information.

*   **The Rulebook:** The master document. Contains all procedural rules, updated daily.
*   **Departmental Directory (Terminal):** A screen on the terminal listing all department names and their corresponding ID codes (e.g., Parks & Rec: #77B).
*   **Budget Ledger (Terminal):** A screen to verify if Project F-37 has sufficient funds.
*   **Material Standards Guide:** A small booklet listing pre-approved materials and color codes.
*   **Signature Archive:** A binder containing the official signatures of all department heads for forgery-checking.

#### D. Informational & Narrative Documents
These documents build the world and provide context, hints, or pressure.

*   **Daily Memo:** A note from management that appears each morning, often containing hints about new "unwritten" rules or policy changes.
*   **Correspondence:** Handwritten notes, letters, or faxes from other characters, like "Brenda," the park manager, showing her growing impatience.
*   **Performance Review:** A summary of your work (errors made, time taken) that affects the narrative.

### List 2: Types of Actions a Page Requires

These are the "verbs" of the game—the specific tasks and checks the player must perform on the documents.

#### A. Information Verification (Checking a field against a known fact)
*   **Date Check:** Does the date on the form match the current game-day?
*   **Signature Check:** Is there a signature in the required box? Does it match the signature in the archive?
*   **Numeric Check:** Does the Department ID on the form match the ID in the Terminal Directory?
*   **Presence Check:** Is a required field (e.g., "Project Location") filled in, or is it blank?
*   **Format Check:** Is the information in the correct format? (e.g., date as MM/DD/YY, budget as $XXX.XX).

#### B. Cross-Referencing (Checking one document against another)
*   **Rule Compliance:** **Read** a statement on a form (e.g., "Material: Oak Wood") and then **check** the Rulebook to see if Oak Wood is an approved material.
*   **Budget Consistency:** **Check** the "Total Cost" on the Budgetary Request form and **compare** it against the available funds shown on the Terminal.
*   **Inter-Form Consistency:** **Compare** the material listed on the Material Specification Sheet with the material listed on the Safety Compliance Checklist. They must match.
*   **Personnel Matching:** **Verify** that the Grade of Technician requested on the Work Order form is covered by the budget allocated on the Budgetary Request.

#### C. Logical Deduction (Applying rules and context)
*   **Categorization:** **Determine** if the project should be classified as "New Installation" or "Maintenance Repair" based on memo descriptions, as each has a different paper trail.
*   **Calculation:** **Sum** the individual line items in a budget request to ensure they add up to the stated total.
*   **Contradiction Identification:** **Recognize** when two different forms or a form and a rule are in direct conflict, forcing a DENIAL or a creative solution.
*   **Information Synthesis:** **Read** a complaint on a Public Comment form and **translate** it into an actionable change on a Material Specification Sheet.

#### D. Decision & Execution (The final action on a document)
*   **Stamping:** After analysis, **apply** the correct stamp (APPROVED, DENIED).
*   **Citing:** If DENIED, **write** or **select** the specific rule number that was violated on a citation slip.
*   **Routing:** **Place** the processed form into the correct out-tray for the next department in the chain.
*   **Attaching:** **Physically connect** one form to another (e.g., attaching the approved Budget form to the main Project Proposal).
